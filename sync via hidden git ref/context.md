## Sync

`yx sync` allows the user to share their TODO list with anyone else working in the same git repository. The changes
to their yak map, committed locally to refs/notes/yaks as an event log, are merged with any changes on the remote, and
pushed.

Any new changes are reflected in the local .yaks directory.
