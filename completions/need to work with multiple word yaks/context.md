I'm finding that for yaks with multiple-word names, I don't get the whole thing in the completion, just the first word.

maybe I'm wrong but that's how it feels.

I'm sure that if I start with a quote, it just gives me the first word quoted.

e.g.

yx add first task
yx rm "fir<tab>
=> yx rm "first"
