## Status: Minimal Argc Implementation - 106/108 Tests Passing ✅

**Breakthrough Approach:**
Started fresh with minimal implementation instead of converting the full script. Much more successful!

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Minimal argc-based bin/yx (73 lines vs 923 in original)
- ✅ All `add` tests pass (13/13)  
- ✅ All `list` tests pass (17/17)
- ✅ argc binary in release zip (lib/ directory)
- ✅ Installer with symlink architecture
- ✅ argc kept out of user PATH
- ✅ Help auto-generated by argc
- ✅ Total: 106/108 tests passing

**Pattern That Works:**
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# @describe Description
# @cmd Command name
# @arg name Argument
command_func() {
  # Implementation using ${argc_name}
}

# Argc eval at END after all functions defined
eval "$("$ARGC_BIN" --argc-eval "$0" "$@")"
```

**Key Learnings:**
1. Use `done_()` for bash keyword conflicts (argc strips trailing underscore)
2. Argc eval must be at END after functions
3. Global gitignore interferes with tests - use `git -c core.excludesfile=/dev/null`

**Next Steps:**
- Fix remaining 2 test failures (see sub-yaks)
- Add remaining commands incrementally
- Consider refactoring pattern (see sub-yak)
