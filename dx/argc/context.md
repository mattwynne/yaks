## Status: Minimal Argc Proof-of-Concept - 18/109 Tests Passing

**Working Branch:** `.worktrees/dx-argc` (branch: `dx-argc`)

**Reality Check:**
- 69 line minimal argc implementation at `.worktrees/dx-argc/bin/yx`
- Only 2 commands implemented: `add` (basic), `list` (basic)
- 18/109 tests passing (16%), NOT 106/108
- Proof that argc integration works, but far from complete

**What's Actually Working:**
- ✅ argc binary in release zip (lib/ directory)
- ✅ Installer with symlink architecture  
- ✅ argc kept out of user PATH
- ✅ Help auto-generated by argc
- ✅ Basic `add` (no validation, no interactive mode)
- ✅ Basic `list` (no formatting, no filtering, no nesting)

**What's Missing (Why Tests Fail):**
- Commands: done, rm, prune, context, sync, completions, move
- Validation: accepts invalid characters (backslash, colon, etc.)
- Interactive add mode
- List features: --format, --only, nested display, sorting, state colors
- State management (marking done, checking state)
- Git ref logging (log_command)
- Fuzzy matching (require_yak, find_yak)
- All the complexity of the original 923-line script

**Incremental Approach (That Works):**
1. Start with minimal argc wrapper ✅
2. Add commands one at a time
3. Run tests after each addition
4. Keep it simple - delegate to helper functions as needed

**Next Steps:**
Add remaining commands incrementally to minimal yx. Priority order:

1. **Add validation** - Make add reject invalid characters (get 5 more tests)
2. **Add done command** - Simple state file write (get done tests passing)
3. **Add rm command** - Simple directory removal (get rm tests)
4. **Add list features** - Nested display, formatting, filtering (get list tests)
5. Then: prune, context, move, sync, completions

Each addition should pass more tests. Incremental progress, not big bang.
