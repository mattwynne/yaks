Right now my yx ls looks like:

  - [x] sync via hidden git ref
- [ ] claim
- [ ] completions need to work with multiple word yaks
- [ ] edit
- [ ] implement in zig or something
- [ ] use context.md files in each directory to avoid .yaks file just for git

This is dumb. The "sync via hidden git ref" is still a child of the "claim" yak and should be displayed beneath it.

we should apply the "done goes first" rule within each group of siblings, not the list as a whole.
